# Fake Review Detection Project üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

A web application built with Python and Streamlit to classify hotel reviews as either **Genuine (Truthful)** or **Deceptive (Fake)**. This project uses a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier trained on the Deceptive Opinion Spam Corpus.

## ‚ú® Features

-   **Real-time Prediction**: Enter any review text and get an instant classification.
-   **Confidence Score**: See the model's confidence in its prediction.
-   **Simple Web Interface**: Easy-to-use interface powered by Streamlit.
-   **Reproducible Model**: A clear training script to reproduce the machine learning model.

## üöÄ Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.8 or higher
-   Git

### 1. Clone the Repository

``bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/fake-review-project.git
cd fake-review-project
Use code with caution.
2. Create a Virtual Environment
It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
For Windows:
Generated bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
Use code with caution.
Bash
For macOS/Linux:
Generated bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
Use code with caution.
Bash
3. Install Dependencies
Install all the required libraries from the requirements.txt file.
Generated bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Use code with caution.
Bash
4. Get the Dataset
The model is trained on the Deceptive Opinion Spam Corpus.
Download the dataset from Kaggle: Deceptive Opinion Spam Corpus.
Make sure the dataset file is named deceptive-opinion.csv.
Place the deceptive-opinion.csv file inside the data/ directory.
üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è How to Run the Project
1. Train the Model
First, you need to run the training script. This will process the data and create the model.pkl and vectorizer.pkl files.
Generated bash
python model_training.py
Use code with caution.
Bash
You will see output in your terminal indicating the training progress and the final model accuracy.
2. Launch the Streamlit App
Once the model is trained and saved, run the Streamlit application.
Generated bash
streamlit run app.py
Use code with caution.
Bash
Your web browser will automatically open, and you can start using the Fake Review Detector!
üß† Model Details
Model: Multinomial Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB)
Feature Extraction: Bag of Words using CountVectorizer.
Dataset: A corpus of 400 truthful and 400 deceptive hotel reviews.
Labels:
truthful is mapped to 1.
deceptive is mapped to 0.

### 2. The `.gitignore` File

This file tells Git which files or folders it should ignore and not track. This is crucial for keeping your repository clean and avoiding committing large files, virtual environments, or sensitive information.

Create a file named `.gitignore` in the root of your project directory and add the following content:
Use code with caution.
Byte-compiled / optimized / C extensions
pycache/
*.py[cod]
*$py.class
C extensions
*.so

Usually these files are written by a python script from a template
before PyInstaller builds the exe, so as to inject date/other infos into it.

### 3. The `LICENSE` File

A license file is essential for an open-source project. It tells others what they can and can't do with your code. The **MIT License** is a great choice as it's simple and permissive.

Create a file named `LICENSE` in the root of your project directory and paste the following text into it. **Remember to replace `[year]` and `[fullname]`.**
Use code with caution.
